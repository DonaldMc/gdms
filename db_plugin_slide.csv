1,1,slide,page-title_article,"## What is Networked Decision Making(NDS)

-Online platform for group decision making
-Supports 3 things:
++ Issue Recording
++ Question Resolution
++ Action Approval

","Networked decision making is an on-line platform for group decision.  It provides an alternative to meetings and voting as they can be highly inefficient.
Issues and actions can both be approved or disapproved while multiple choice questions get resolved when the set number of consecutive answers are recorded.",,,,,||
2,1,slide,page-title_article,"##Why this matters

-World is underachieving
-Potentially a matter of life or death for half the planet
-No Global Strategy
-No focus
-Debt restructuring may make things worse
-Time for a change","The lack of alignment and achievement on this planet is not something that only affects other people.  It will probably kill you unless something else does first.

There is an urgent need to get our act together and come up with a plan to extend life expectancy and improve the standards of human behaviour if we want to have longer happier lives.",,,,,||

6,1,slide,page-title_channel,"##Why will it succeed

-Change is seldom welcomed 
-So unfortunately it will be slow
-Proposing some incentives to accelerate - specifically discussing appropriate criteria for entitlement to future life extending healthcare
-Social networking and democracy are both well established
-Inevitably, eventually the possibility to combine will twig and a tipping point will be reached
-Sooner the better if we want long happy lives
